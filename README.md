This tool efficiently processes data from Excel files, performs necessary calculations, and manages database interactions to produce accurate and insightful reports.

## Features

*   **Excel Data Processing:** Seamlessly reads and processes data from various Excel file formats.
*   **Automated Calculations:** Executes complex calculations based on the processed data to derive key metrics.
*   **Database Management:** Manages data storage and retrieval, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.
*   **Customizable Report Generation:** Generates detailed and customizable reports tailored to LMS requirements.
*   **Modular Design:** Built with a modular structure for easy maintenance and scalability.
